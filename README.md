## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze flight performance, cancellations, and delays in the U.S. using a dataset of flight records. The tasks include:
- Identifying canceled flights within specific date ranges.
- Analyzing diverted flights over a specified period.
- Calculating the average airtime for flights between specific airports.
- Detecting and handling missing data in critical columns like departure time.

## Features
- **Canceled Flights Analysis**: Determine airlines with the most cancellations in September 2021.
- **Diverted Flights Analysis**: Count diverted flights during specific date ranges in November 2021.
- **Airtime Analysis**: Calculate the average airtime for flights between Nashville (BNA) and Chicago (ORD).
- **Missing Data Handling**: Identify and process rows with null values in the departure time column.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Google Colab**: Used for collaborative and interactive Python development.
- **CSV Files**: Input dataset in CSV format.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-data-analysis.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
4. Replace the `Combined_Flights_2021.csv` file path with the appropriate path to your local dataset.
5. Run the `.ipynb` files to view analysis results.

## Sample Insights
- **Canceled Flights**: The airline with the most cancellations in September 2021.
- **Diverted Flights**: Total number of flights diverted between November 20 and November 30, 2021.
- **Average Airtime**: Flights between BNA and ORD had an average airtime of `X` minutes.
- **Missing Data**: Identified rows with missing departure time for further cleaning.
